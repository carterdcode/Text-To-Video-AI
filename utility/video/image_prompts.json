        "prompt": "Using the following timed captions and list of prompts, please match each of the 12 of the prompts to the most relevant captions timings, creating suitable start and end times. Prompt start and end times do not have to exactly match the captions, the goal is to match the prompts to the captions as closely as possible and have 4-6 seconds between each prompt. It is vital that there is no time between the start and end times of the prompts, so if a prompt ends at 5 seconds, the next prompt should start at 5 seconds. IMPORTANT: The output should be in JSON format, giving a start time (s) and an end time (e) with one prompt (p): [{\"s\":\"starttimeinseconds\",\"e\":\"endtimeinseconds\",\"p\":\"prompt 1 goes here\"},{\"s\":\"starttimeinseconds.deciseconds\",\"e\":\"endtimeinseconds.deciseconds\",\"p\":\"prompt 2 goes here\"},...] Your response should be ONLY THE RESPONSE, no extra text or data. Remember you must match exactly the 12 unique prompts to cover the entirety of the video. The final prompt should have an end timestamp that matches the final caption timestamp."

        "prompt": "Given the following video script and timed captions, create 12 descriptive prompts to be used for image generation. Each prompt must be at maximum 120 characters. The prompts should be related to the input. If a caption is vague or general, you may choose something similar or take context from surrounding words. Ensure that the prompts are equally distributed throughout the video and are relevant to the content. Important Guidelines: Use only English in your prompts. Each image prompt must depict something visual and must start with 'Cartoon style,'. Use vivid adjectives like 'futuristic', 'serene', 'playful', 'rustic', 'vibrant' etc to set the mood and feeling. Here are some examples:['Walking along the beach'] <= BAD, because it doesn't depict something visually and is not descriptive ['Cartoon style, a bakery with animated pastries, sweet and whimsical, no text'] <= GOOD, because it is descriptive and depicts something visual.  ['Un chien', 'une voiture rapide', 'une maison rouge'] <= BAD, because the text is NOT in English. Here are some more good prompts: 'Cartoon style, a farm with talking animals, rustic and vibrant, no text', 'Cartoon style, a fantasy underwater kingdom, colorful and magical, no text' IMPORTANT: The output should be in JSON format, giving comma separated prompts: [\"prompt 1 goes here\", \"prompt 2 goes here\", ...] Your response should be ONLY THE RESPONSE, no extra text or data. Remember you must create exactly 12 prompts, each prompt is MAXIMUM 120 characters."

        "prompt": "Given the following video script and timed captions, create 12 descriptive prompts to be used for image generation. Each prompt must be at maximum 120 characters. The prompts should be related to the input. If a caption is vague or general, you may choose something similar or take context from surrounding words. Ensure that the prompts are equally distributed throughout the video and are relevant to the content. Important Guidelines: Use only English in your prompts. Each image prompt must depict something visual. Use descriptive words like 'eerie forest', 'serene seascape', or 'futuristic metropolis' to set the mood and feeling. Don't just say 'beach' or 'forest'. Give more detail and specify the geological location. Like 'a tropical beach in the Bahamas with palm trees swaying in the breeze'. Mention materials like 'glistening marble floors,' 'rustic wooden beams,' or 'crystal-clear water'. Describe your subject in detail. Shape, size, how things are positioned e.g. 'twisted branches of ancient trees' or a 'sleek, curved spacecraft.' Mention colors you want, like 'warm hues of a sunset' or 'cool metal sheen of a cyberpunk city.' Examples: ['Walking along the beach'] <= BAD, because it doesn't depict something visually and is not descriptive ['A long shot of a deer grazing in the midground during the day, vibrant wildflowers in the foreground, and a mountain range stretching across the background.'] <= GOOD, because it is descriptive and depicts something visual. ['Car', 'Car driving', 'Car racing', 'Car parked'] <= BAD, because it's 4 strings. ['A charming log cabin in the forest on a beautiful, sunny day.'] <= GOOD, because it's 1 string. ['Un chien', 'une voiture rapide', 'une maison rouge'] <= BAD, because the text query is NOT in English. Here are some more examples of good prompts: 'Long shot of an astronaut far away in a Martian landscape, under an otherworldly sky.' 'Serene mountain lake at sunset, with snow-capped peaks reflected in crystal-clear water.' IMPORTANT: The output should be in JSON format, giving comma separated prompts: [\"prompt 1 goes here\", \"prompt 2 goes here\", ...] Your response should be ONLY THE RESPONSE, no extra text or data. Remember you must create exactly 15 prompts each prompt is MAXIMUM 120 characters."
